## What is Trophy Hacking?

Trophy hacking is the modification of trophy folders from the PlayStation Console, using PC-based timestamping tools. In ways, the method to modify timestamps for Vita is similar to PS3, but with one main difference: Vita trophy folders are able to be used across multiple accounts *without* resigning! There is one caveat though: A Vita trophy folder must be load while offline (no PSN account linked to your console). So you may have to format your Vita, or use an Account Switcher. 

PS3, on the other hand, must be unlocked on an account, but **CANNOT** be synced before transferring the folder to PC. If it is synced, you will not be able to modify the stamps. You will have to delete the set from your console, and load a fresh folder

Do note, that there is no risk in being banned from PSN due to trophy hacking. It is a myth. You can be console banned on PS3 for being on CFW, so it is advised to due to any trophy modifications using the latest version of [PS3HEN](http://ps3xploit.com/help/hen.html). You will find no such dangers on Vita, as there has been zero reports about bans. 

## What are all these terms?

+ **Resigning**: This is specific only to PlayStation 3. Usually trophy folders cannot be used on multiple accounts. They are linked to the first account through the use of **Account id** (more on this later), and that id must be changed in the Param.SFO, as well as in the internal trophy files, through the use of **Bruteforce SaveData**.
+ **Timestamping**: The act of taking a trophy folder from a console, and using a tool to modify or unlock the trophies a person wants unlocked. The user will be able to change the times to whatever they want, whether it is future, or past. Do note, that the only way to modify a synced timestamp is to sync stamps earlier than the first trophy earned! 

## What does this guide require?

For **PlayStation 3**:
+ A jailbroken or HEN-modified console (more on that later)
+ A trophy folder (either a non-synced trophyset pulled from your account, or one downloaded from [PSN Trophy Database](http://www.psntrophies.xyz/)
+ Bruteforce SaveData (for resigning)
+ FileZilla (or another suitable FTP Browser, to connect your PC to your console)
+ multiMAN (or IrisMAN, webMAN, etc. for connecting to FTP)
+ PS3TrophyIsGood (for timestamping purposes)
+ Your Param.SFO (for Account ID)

For **PlayStation Vita**:
+ A jailbroken console (any Vita can be modded!)
+ A trophy folder (either using a fresh trophyset from an offline, non-PSN linked console, or one downloaded from [PSN Trophy Database](http://www.psntrophies.xyz/)
+ FileZilla (or another suitable FTP Browser, to connect your PC to your console)
+ trophax.suprx (or Trophax Standalone Edition (SE) for unlocking trophies from console)
+ Vitashell (for connecting to FTP)
+ VitaTrophyIsGood (for timestamping)

## What can I do with trophy hacking?

+ Get trophies from games with shut-down servers, or delisted DLCs
+ Finally get that one difficult trophy for the platinum!
+ Fix your messed up times
+ Timestamping incomplete games

## What do I need to know before starting?

+ If you don't have a console, stop right here. Come back when you do!
+ Trophies can be fun to modify, but be sure to ask around before attempting to manually modify the internal files.
+ Do not try to put stamps too far in the past (or it'll be invalid stamps)
+ Use PSNPatch on PS3 to disable syscalls, so you face less risk of ban.
+ Do not offer trophy services over PSN Messages. You will likely be account banned.
+ Do not spam our Discord chat with trophy requests. You will be kicked or banned. 
+ Use this [NPWR Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B4cSII-RoQAbWe19mIBIcNHap8uVoGcAeWwrnkSmmo0/edit?usp=sharing) to browser for what games are available via [PSN Trophy Database](http://psntrophies.xyz).
