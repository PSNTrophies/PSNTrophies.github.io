### Required Reading

Trophy hacking on the Vita is very simple, but there are various tools at your disposal, that can expand the process. Note, that everything covered in the guide **will** work on **PlayStation TV**, as we have tested these methods on both Vita and TV!

While we will be mainly focusing on **TropHAX 2.0**, we will go over **TropHAX Standalone Edition (SE)** and **Trophy Dumper** for use with **vitatrophyisgood** as mentioned on the previous page of this guide. **TropHAX SE** will likely be on its own page. 

### What You Need

* [0syscall6.skprx](https://github.com/SKGleba/0syscall6/releases) (for patching the Vita to run higher firmware games)
  + You will not need **reF00D** or any Compatibility Packs, since this plugin will allow your Vita to naitvely run any game, regardless of your firmware.
  + Still, it is recommended to stay on 3.60 or 3.65 firmware, although it should work on higher firmewares. 
* [config.txt](/assets/files/config.txt) (for your `suprx`'s and `skprx`'s to work correctly)
* [NoNpDrm.skprx](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/NoNpDrm) (for running games from **PKGj**)
* [PKGj](https://github.com/blastrock/pkgj/releases) (for downloading Vita games from **NoPayStation**)
* [TropHAX 2.0.suprx](https://bitbucket.org/SilicaAndPina/trophax/downloads/) (for unlocking trophies while in-game)
  + Optional: [TropHAX SE](https://bitbucket.org/SilicaAndPina/trophaxse/src/master/) (in the case, that you would rather unlock several games without having to load each one. This will require the trophyset already being loaded in the Trophy App.) 
* [TrophyDumper](https://bitbucket.org/SilicaAndPina/trophydumper/src/master/) (for use with **psvtrophyisgood**, as the timestamper requires decrypted data files, which cannot be done by the PC.)
* [VitaShell](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaShell/releases)

### Instructions

#### Section I - Drag-and-Drop

1. Launch **VitaShell** (or **MolecularShell**)
1. Press (Select) to enable FTP access on your device
1. Open your FTP client on your computer
1. Enter the IP Address and Port displayed on your device
1. Using your FTP client, navigate to `ur0:user/00/trophy/` (if the `trophy` directory does not exist, it means you have not loaded any trophysets yet. Simple create the directory. Trophy folders found on [PSN Trophy Database](http://psntrophies.xyz/) will have the `trophy` directory already supplied!
1. Drag your trophy folder(s)' `conf` and `data` into the `trophy` directory on your Vita.
  + If the `trophy` directory is part of the .rar, you can simply drop the whole `trophy` into the `00` directory.
  + If you have multiple trophy folders downloaded from **PSN Trophy Database**, you can extract them all at once. THey will all end up with their contents in one `trophy` directory, for which you can Drag-and-Drop into your Vita. This saves a lot of time and hassle!
1. Make sure there are no _Queued files_ (at the bottom of **FileZilla** (or whatever FTP Client you're using.)
  + Check for any _Failed transfers_
    * If you see any, simple click the tab, and go into the empty field, and right-click. Select `Reset and requeue all`. Go back to _Queued files_ and then right click, and select `Process Queue`.
1. Once all files are done transferring, press (Circle) on your Vita, to exit FTP mode.
1. Press your Home Button (represented by the PS Symbol), to exit **VitaShell** (or your Vita's file browser)
1. Scroll up on your Vita, and select the **Trophy App**. Load the trophies using the **PS Vita/PSTV System** tab, not the **PlayStation Network** tab. You should get an error. Keep going, and the **Trophies App** will refresh its database. Patiently wait for all he trophysets to load in to the App, then go to the PSN Account tab.
1. Enter your PSN info, and begin syncing.
  + If you're already signed in, then just sync.
  + If you can't sign in, go to the **Settings App** on your homescreen, and then **Henkaku Settings**. Change Spoofed FW to 3.73 (or whatever FW is latest at the time of you accessing this guide). Then go back to the **Trophies App** and try again.
1. Once done, you can safely delete the trophy folders from your `ur0` trophy directory, and proceeed to transfer more folders to your Vita. Be sure to delete the resultant `sce_trop` and `db` directories.
1. Congrats on syncing modded trophies! Wanna unlock your own now? 

#### Section II - Unlock Your Own Trophies

1. Open **VitaShell**
1. Press `Select`
1. Open **FileZilla** (or your FTP Client), and connect to your Vita.
1. Proceed to `ur0:tai/`, then drop in the `config.txt` from above, as well as the `trophax2.0.suprx`, as `NoNpDrm.skprx` and `0syscall6.skprx`.
1. Drag your `PKGj.vpk` into any directory, though most people recommend creating a directory in `ux0` or `ur0` called `vpk/`.
  + Only do this if you're wanting to unlock trophies for games you do not own.
  + If using your own game, skip to **step 9.**
1. Install the vpk to your Vita.
1. Reboot your Vita.
  + Not necessary if you're going to run games you own as cartridges.
1. Run `PKGj` app, and it should refresh and load up all the Vita games from **NoPayStation's** database.
  + Choose a title, press **X**, and download. If you get a `scel0` error, make sure the directory `bgdl` exists in `ux0`, then retry.
1. Once the game is installed (or you have your cart inserted into your Vita), run the game. Once the game is at its main menu, proceed to press `Start` and `Select` (`Options` and `Share` if using a **PlayStation 4** Controller on your **PlayStation TV**). If done correctly, **TropHAX** will prompt you to press `L` and `R` back buttons (`L1` and `R1` for PS3 or PS4 Controller) to unlock all trophies.
  + Press  `L` & `Start` (`L1` & `Options` if using PS4 Controller) to choose specific trophies to unlock. It will tell you what to do from there.
1. If all goes well, all the trophies (or the specific trophies) will be unlocked in the **Trophies App**.
  + If you get error unlocking trophies (such as `ret: 80551604`), you may have to delete the trophyset and try again, or proceed to using **TroHAX SE**. **TropHAX SE** Guide can be found at: INSERT URL HERE...
1. Congrats on unlocking your own trophies! If you did this offline without a PSN account linked, you can share your folders with others!
  + If you do so, do be sure to delete `sce_trop` and `db` directories before exporting the trophy folders to your computer. They are unneeded and will lead to the trophysets not appearing in the **Trophies App** on other devices!
  + If you want to change the stamps (Note: This must be done **BEFORE** you sync, as you cannot change synced timestamps!), then proceed to the **TrophyDumper** Section of this Guide, so you can decrypt your trophy folder(s). Then proceed to the final page of our guide, to learn how to use **psvtrophyisgood** to timestamp!
  + You can change synced stamps **only** if you change the stamps to before you earned your first trophy! (For example: If you first trophy earn for that specific game was on `May 1st, 2020`, you will need to change one of your trophies to `April 30th, 2020` or earlier. After that, other stamps can be changed.
