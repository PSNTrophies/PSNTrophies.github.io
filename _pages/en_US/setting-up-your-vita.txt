### Required Reading

Trophy hacking on the Vita is very simple, but there are various tools at your reach, that can expand the process.

While we will be mainly focusing on **TropHAX 2.0**, we will go over **TropHAX Standalone Edition (SE)** and **Trophy Dumper** for use with **vitatrophyisgood** as mentionen on the previous page of this guide.

### What You Need

* [TropHAX 2.0.suprx](https://bitbucket.org/SilicaAndPina/trophax/downloads/) (for unlocking trophies while in-game)
  + Optional: [TropHAX SE](https://bitbucket.org/SilicaAndPina/trophaxse/src/master/) (in the case, that you would rather unlock several games without having to load each one. This will require the trophyset already being loaded in the Trophy App.) 
* [TrophyDumper](https://bitbucket.org/SilicaAndPina/trophydumper/src/master/) (for use with **psvtrophyisgood**, as the timestamper requires decrypted data files, which cannot be done by the PC.)
