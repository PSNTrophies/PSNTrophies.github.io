### Required Reading

Trophy hacking on the Vita is very simple, but there are various tools at your reach, that can expand the process.

While we will be mainly focusing on **TropHAX 2.0**, we will go over **TropHAX Standalone Edition (SE)** and **Trophy Dumper** for use with **vitatrophyisgood** as mentionen on the previous page of this guide.

### What You Need

* [TropHAX 2.0.suprx](https://bitbucket.org/SilicaAndPina/trophax/downloads/) (for unlocking trophies while in-game)
  + Optional: [TropHAX SE](https://bitbucket.org/SilicaAndPina/trophaxse/src/master/) (in the case, that you would rather unlock several games without having to load each one. This will require the trophyset already being loaded in the Trophy App.) 
* [TrophyDumper](https://bitbucket.org/SilicaAndPina/trophydumper/src/master/) (for use with **psvtrophyisgood**, as the timestamper requires decrypted data files, which cannot be done by the PC.)

### Instructions

#### Section I - Drag-and-Drop

1. Launch **VitaShell** (or **MolecularShell**)
1. Press (Select) to enable FTP access on your device
1. Open your FTP client on your computer
1. Enter the IP Address and Port displayed on your device
1. Using your FTP client, navigate to `ur0:` » `user/` » `00/` » `trophy/` (if the `trophy` directory does not exist, it means you have not loaded any trophysets yet. Simple create the directory. Trophy folders found on [PSN Trophy Database](http://psntrophies.xyz/) will have the `trophy` directory already supplied!
1. Drag your trophy folder(s)' `conf` and `data` into the `trophy` directory on your Vita.
  + If the `trophy` directory is part of the .rar, you can simply drop the whole `trophy` into the `00` directory.
  + If you have multiple trophy folders downloaded from **PSN Trophy Database**, you can extract them all at once. THey will all end up with their contents in one `trophy` directory, for which you can Drag-and-Drop into your Vita. This saves a lot of time and hassle!
1. Make sure there are no _Queued files_ (at the bottom of **FileZilla** (or whatever FTP Client you're using.)
  + Check for any _Failed transfers_
    * If you see any, simple click the tab, and go into the empty field, and right-click. Select `Reset and requeue all`. Go back to _Queued files_ and then right click, and select `Process Queue`.
1. Once all files are done transferring, press (Circle) on your Vita, to exit FTP mode.
1. Press your Home Button (represented by the PS Symbol), to exit **VitaShell** (or your Vita's file browser)
1. Scroll up on your Vita, and select the **Trophy App**. Load the trophies offline (not on account). You should get an error. Keep going, and the **Trophy App** will refresh its database. Patiently wait for all he trophysets to load in to the App, then go to the PSN Account tab.
1. Enter your PSN info, and begin syncing.
  + If you're already signed in, then just sync.
  + If you can't sign in, go to the **Settings App** on your homescreen, and then **Henkaku Settings**. Change Spoofed FW to 3.73 (or whatever FW is latest at the time of you accessing this guide). Then go back to the **Trophy App** and try again.
1. Once done, you can safely delete the trophy folders from your `ur0` trophy directory, and proceeed to transfer more folders to your Vita. Be sure to delete the resultant `sce_trop` and `db` directories.
